0.  Business task:  Analyze smart product to see how customers are using.
Set out high-level recommendations based on analysis process.

Guidelines:
Ask SMART questions: specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant and time-bound.

Ask:
Study trends in smart device use, how these trends would apply to Bellabeat customers,
and how these trends could influence their strategy.

Key stakeholders are analyists, a mathematician, and the chief creative officer.
Therefore, my presentation will include some mathematical insights,
presented in a high-level way, with details of mathematics given in appendix.

a.  How many individual users are there in the data?	done
b.  Over what time was the data collected?	done
c.  What are the peak times in activity during a typical day for users?
d.  What are mean steps/day for users?
d.  What are trends in steps v calories,
			intensity v calories
			intensity/step v calories
			heartrate v calories
			heartrate v intensity


Prepare:

1.  Load csv files into BigQuery tables.
2.  Use BigQuery to create some summary stats and clean data.
3.  Ensure proper formatting by enforcing table shema upon
table creation in BigQuery.  Check for missing values and potential errors in data.
Remove data that takes away from the integrity and document any data
removed and/or not used in the analysis.

The plan here is to use BigQuery to clean the data and give some summary
stats.  Then, use R to perform more detailed analysis on cleaned data
and to produce visualizations.

Issue 1:  BigQuery is unable to parse date and time values in hourly and minute csv tables.
Issue 2:  Google Sheets has trouble handling data required to text-split the date-time entries.
Solution:  Write python script to directly modify the csv files.  Create updated csv file(s)
with date-time object split into date and 24-hour time.

format for csv files to be uploaded as DATETIME:  YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
